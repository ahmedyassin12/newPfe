# 🎓 Formation & Event Management Platform - Backend API

This is a **backend system** for managing a Training Center (`Centre de Formation`) where **students can enroll in formations (multi-course programs) or events**. Managers assign instructors (formateurs) to courses, and the system provides full tracking of participation and feedback.

> 🛡️ Includes robust **JWT-based authentication**, full **CRUD support**, **Dockerized PostgreSQL**, **Cloudinary integration**, and insightful **ETL dashboards via Power BI**.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👨‍🎓 Student Module:
- Register and update personal info
- Enroll in **formations** (programs with multiple courses)
- Sign up for **events**

### 👨‍🏫 Manager Module:
- Manage formations, courses, and events
- Assign courses to formateurs
- View ratings and participation metrics

### ⚙️ Full CRUD Operations
All core entities (Students, Formations, Courses, Events, Managers,Enrollement) support:
- **Create**
- **Read**
- **Update**
- **Delete**

### 🔐 JWT Security (JSON Web Token)

- Implements **stateless authentication** using JWT
- Each request must include a valid token in headers
- Access is controlled by **user roles** (e.g., student, manager, admin)
- Token contains user identity and role info for secured endpoints
- Expiration and refresh logic ensures optimal security and performance
- **Efficient filtering and exception handling** to prevent unauthorized access

> 🛡️ Your app is protected by token-based security that scales — no sessions, just signed tokens and smart middleware.
